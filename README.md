# R-PIAS
My mission is to revolutionize agriculture in Brazil through a synthesis of cutting-edge research, technological innovation, and evidence-based public policy. I am dedicated to pioneering solutions that harmonize agricultural productivity with environmental stewardship.

My work is centered on a portfolio of interconnected, high-impact fields:
Sustainable Agriculture: Agroecology, Permaculture, Sustainable Family Farming, and Ecological Engineering.
Environmental Technology: ESG-driven technologies, advanced environmental diagnostics, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services (including Payments for Ecosystem Services - PES).
Bioeconomy & Biotech: Carbon credits, bioproducts, biotechnology, and the valuation of biodiversity's intrinsic worth.
Data & Territorial Intelligence: GeoAI, remote sensing, IoT sensors (including LoRa for remote connectivity), Big Data, and sustainable territorial planning.

I believe that scientific entrepreneurship is our most critical tool in averting environmental and climatic collapse. To that end, I am continuously developing fundable projects in these areas and actively seeking to enhance my expertise in Data Science (Python, R), AI, automation, and technologies for a sustainable Agriculture 4.0/5.0.

As a faculty member at Profnit (IFMT, Primavera do Leste) and the Graduate Program in Ecology and Conservation (UNEMAT, Nova Xavantina), I bridge my background as a quantitative ecologist with a passion for creating multi-purpose innovations that span education, agriculture, environmental management, and entrepreneurship. I also serve as the Co-Lead for TBA in Primavera do Leste.

I approach this work with humility, an eagerness to learn from experts, and a commitment to building powerful partnerships to address real-world challenges in a rapidly changing world.

Our multidisciplinary team operates at multiple scales—from foundational research to applied science and technological innovation, ensuring that education and outreach are integral to every initiative.

I am actively seeking academic, public-private, and inventor partners, with a special focus on connecting with investors who share this vision.
