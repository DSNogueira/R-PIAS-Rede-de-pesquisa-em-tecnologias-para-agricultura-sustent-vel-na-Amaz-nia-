# R-PIAS
Our mission is to revolutionize agriculture in Brazil through a synthesis of cutting-edge research, technological innovation, and evidence-based public policy. We are dedicated to pioneering solutions that harmonize agricultural productivity with environmental stewardship.

Our work is centered on a portfolio of interconnected, high-impact fields:
Sustainable Agriculture: Agroecology, Permaculture, Sustainable Family Farming, and Ecological Engineering.
Environmental Technology: ESG-driven technologies, advanced environmental diagnostics, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services (including Payments for Ecosystem Services - PES).
Bioeconomy & Biotech: Carbon credits, bioproducts, biotechnology, and the valuation of biodiversity's intrinsic worth.
Data & Territorial Intelligence: GeoAI, remote sensing, IoT sensors (including LoRa for remote connectivity), Big Data, and sustainable territorial planning.

we believe that scientific entrepreneurship is our most critical tool in averting environmental and climatic collapse. To that end, we are continuously developing fundable projects in these areas and actively seeking to enhance my expertise in Data Science (Python, R, GEE), AI, automation, and technologies for a sustainable Agriculture 4.0/5.0.

As a faculty member at Profnit (IFMT, Primavera do Leste) and the Graduate Program in Ecology and Conservation (UNEMAT, Nova Xavantina), I bridge my background as a quantitative ecologist with a passion for creating multi-purpose innovations that span education, agriculture, sustainable environmental management, and entrepreneurship. I also serve as the Co-Lead for TBA in Primavera do Leste and member of the Teaching, Research, and Extension Council of IFMT, and member of the Upper Rio das Mortes River Basin Committee. I serve as Coordinator of Research, Graduate Studies, and Innovation at IFMT and PI Coordinator of the Research Network on Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture – Pro-Amazônia: Integrated Platform for Sustainable Agroecosystems.

We approach this work with humility, an eagerness to learn from experts, and a commitment to building powerful partnerships to address real-world challenges in a rapidly changing world.

Our multidisciplinary team operates at multiple scales—from foundational research to applied science and technological innovation, ensuring that education and outreach are integral to every initiative.

We are actively seeking academic, public-private, and inventor partners, with a special focus on connecting with investors who share this vision.
